### Overview

This is an efficient, and lightweight desktop app implementation of the [PhysicsWallah](https://pw.live) website. 

They have a really nice website, but running within a browser tab is not always efficient and can be sometimes distracting, so that is why I made this desktop with Tauri, a modern rust framework.

- [Windows](https://github.com/its-ag/PhysicsWallah-Desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/Physics.Wallah_1.0.1_x64_en-US.msi)
